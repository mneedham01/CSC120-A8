Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The class represents a raven living near Sitka, Alaska. It can grab an object if it's not alreading holding something in their claws, drop an item if it is holding it in its claws, examine an item, use an item if it is holding it, walk in 5 mile increments in four directions, fly to any location within the 100 mile square area, shrink (fold its wings in in order to rest), grow (bring its wings out in order to fly), and then rest (any other action changes the raven to not resting), and go back to its most recent location. 

I also implemented a toString method that prints out all the relevant information of the raven. 

It was a fun assignment. Some of the instructions from the Contract.java didn't have as much relevance (like the shrink and grow returning a Number). I would say to have FUN!!!
